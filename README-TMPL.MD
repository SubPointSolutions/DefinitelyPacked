# DefinitelyTyped (beta)
DefinitelyTyped is a repository for common, community-driven [MetaPack](https://github.com/SubPointSolutions/MetaPack) packages. We are aiming to bring together high-quality packages to help SharePoint professionals and develop and deliver solutions for SharePoint - both on-premises and SharePoint online.

### How does that work?
We created [MetaPack](http://docs.subpointsolutions.com/metapack/) introducing a common, open-source infrastructure for packaging, delivering and deploying SharePoint solutions.

It leverages NuGet platform to handle packaging, versioning and dependency management for SharePoint solutions. In a nutshell, MetaPack turns SharePoint customizations into NuGet packages so that we can reference other packages, version it and then push to any NuGet gallery you've got.

A beautiful part of MetaPack is packaging and deployment abstraction. You have full control over solution packaging and deployment, and we provide out of the box support for [SharePointPnP](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP) and [SPMeta2](https://github.com/SubPointSolutions/spmeta2) - some of the most popular provisioning libraries for SharePoint.

Once you've for your solution in NuGet Gallery, you can deploy it with [MetaPack API](http://docs.subpointsolutions.com/metapack/getting-started/) or [command line interface](http://docs.subpointsolutions.com/metapack/cli/). 

Please refer to MetaPack documentation to get more understanding on how underlying infrastructure works:

* [Using MetaPack CLI](http://docs.subpointsolutions.com/metapack/cli)

### Getting started with DefinitelyPacked
Firs of all, you need to install the latest [MetaPack CLI](http://docs.subpointsolutions.com/metapack/cli). Once done, you would be able to deploy all DefinitelyPacked packages as easy as this:

#### SharePoint Online provision
```ps
metapack install `
        --id "package-id" `
        --url "http://contoso-intranet.sharepoint.com" `
        --username "user@contoso.com" `
        --userpassword "pass@word1" `
        --spversion "o365"
```

#### SharePoint 2013 provision
```ps
metapack install `
        --id "package-id" `
        --url "http://contoso-intranet.sharepoint.com" `
        --username "user@contoso.com" `
        --userpassword "pass@word1" `
        --spversion "sp2013"
```

**DefinitelyPacked is in beta testing**, so please add --source to get packages from the following NuGet feed as following:
* Build NuGet feed: [https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/definitelypacked-nuget](https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/definitelypacked-nuget)

```ps
metapack install `
        --id "package-id" `
        --url "http://contoso-intranet.sharepoint.com" `
        --username "user@contoso.com" `
        --userpassword "pass@word1" `
        --spversion "o365"
		--source https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/definitelypacked-nuget
```

More options for deployments via MetaPack CLI are available here:
* [MetaPack CLI](http://docs.subpointsolutions.com/metapack/cli)
* [MetaPack API](http://docs.subpointsolutions.com/metapack/getting-started)
